# A little bit about me:

I have a diploma in advance computer studies and bachelors degree in computer science, but my masters degree in computer science is incomplete.

My first experience with programming was in 1985, though back then it was entering code from a book and finding out what it did.

Nowadays I fiddle with a mixture of Linux, Windows and Android devices and I write code mainly in C#, though I have experience writing code in:
- (Visual) Basic
- C / C++
- Java
- PHP / HTML / Javascript
- Standard ML
